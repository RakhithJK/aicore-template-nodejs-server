## Internals
### Testing framework: Mocha , assertion style: chai
 See https://mochajs.org/#getting-started on how to write tests
 Use chai for BDD style assertions (expect, should etc..). See move here: https://www.chaijs.com/guide/styles/#expect

### Mocks and spies: sinon
 if you want to mock/spy on fn() for unit tests, use sinon. refer docs: https://sinonjs.org/

### Note on coverage suite used here:
we use c8 for coverage https://github.com/bcoe/c8. Its reporting is based on nyc, so detailed docs can be found
 here: https://github.com/istanbuljs/nyc ; We didn't use nyc as it do not yet have ES module support
 see: https://github.com/digitalbazaar/bedrock-test/issues/16 . c8 is drop replacement for nyc coverage reporting tool
